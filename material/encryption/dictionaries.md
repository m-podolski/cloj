# Dictionaries

1. OpenNLP: The Apache OpenNLP library provides natural language processing (NLP) tools, including pre-trained models and dictionaries for various languages. While it's primarily focused on NLP tasks like tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and named entity recognition, it can also be used for dictionary-based tasks. You can use OpenNLP with Clojure using libraries like clojure-opennlp.

1. Hunspell: Hunspell is a widely-used spell checking library that provides dictionaries for many languages, including English and German. There are Clojure libraries available that provide bindings to the Hunspell library, allowing you to perform spell checking and other dictionary-based tasks. One such library is clojure-hunspell.

1. WordNet: WordNet is a lexical database of English words and their semantic relationships. There are Java libraries available for accessing WordNet, which can be used with Clojure. For example, you can use the JWNL (Java WordNet Library) with Clojure to access WordNet data.

1. LanguageTool: LanguageTool is an open-source grammar and style checker that supports multiple languages, including English and German. It provides pre-built dictionaries and language rules for detecting grammar and style errors in text. While it's primarily designed for grammar checking, it includes dictionaries that can be used for other purposes as well.

1. Google Translate API: If you need translation capabilities along with dictionaries, you can use the Google Translate API, which supports a wide range of languages, including English and German. There are Clojure libraries available for interacting with the Google Translate API.
